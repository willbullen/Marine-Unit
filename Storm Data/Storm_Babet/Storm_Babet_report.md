## Meteorological Analysis

### Wind Analysis

The storm produced maximum sustained winds of **36.2 m/s** (130.4 km/h), representing significant marine weather conditions. Wind speeds of this magnitude pose considerable risks to marine operations and coastal areas.

**Wind Categories:**
- Force 7 (Strong Gale): 13.9-17.1 m/s (50-61 km/h)
- Force 8 (Gale): 17.2-20.7 m/s (62-74 km/h)  
- Force 9 (Strong Gale): 20.8-24.4 m/s (75-88 km/h)
- Force 10+ (Storm): >24.5 m/s (>88 km/h)


### Wave Analysis  

**Significant Wave Heights (Hm0):** Peak values reached **7.7 m**, representing **high** sea states according to the World Meteorological Organization classification.

**Maximum Wave Heights (Hmax):** Individual wave heights peaked at **13.3 m**, representing **very high** conditions for maximum wave heights.

**Wave Height Relationship:** The Hmax/Hm0 ratio was **1.72**, within normal range (1.3-1.8).

**Sea State Classification (Hm0):**
- Rough: 2.5-4.0 m
- Very Rough: 4.0-6.0 m
- High: 6.0-9.0 m
- Very High: 9.0-14.0 m
- Phenomenal: >14.0 m

**Wave Height Definitions:**
- **Hm0 (Significant Wave Height):** Average height of the highest one-third of waves
- **Hmax (Maximum Wave Height):** Highest individual wave recorded during the period


### Pressure Analysis

Atmospheric pressure dropped to a minimum of **970.6 hPa**, representing a pressure anomaly of 42.7 hPa below standard atmospheric pressure (1013.25 hPa).

**Pressure Categories:**
- Normal: 1013-1023 hPa
- Low: 1000-1013 hPa
- Very Low: 980-1000 hPa  
- Extremely Low: <980 hPa
